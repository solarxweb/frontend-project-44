### Good day!
I'am Daniil Romanenko and this is my small project which contains are few mini-games.
If you are wanted to play some, you need to do these steps:

 - clone this repository to local repository
 - use 'make install' to install dependencies
 - use 'npm link' to install packages
 - write short command which will start the game
 -- project can work w/ these five short commands:
	 brain-calc - Calculator.
	 brain-even - Decide, which is number. Even or odd.
	 brain-prime - Decide, which is number. Common or composite.
	 brain-progression - Find number in sequence.
	 brain-gcd - Find the greater common number.

Below, in asciinemas, you can see how look each game.
